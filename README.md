# NST-Part-II-Chem-Programming

This is my first programming exercise. 
In the first exercise, I wrote a programme that determines the HÃ¼ckel energies and degeneracies of polyene and 3 Platonic solids.

## User Input
Running the programming you will see "Type of the molecule is 1-polyene; 2-sp2 Platonic solid (enter the number)".

Simply follow the prompt, type `1` for polyene and `2` for Platonic solid.
If other characters are used, you will see "Invalid input. Please try again". And it's time to try again:)

If you typed `1` for polyene, you will then see the prompt asking for `cyclic` or `linear`, as well as for the number of atoms. Wrong input, including any thing other than `cyclic`, `linear` or positive integer `n`, will return "This is not a valid polyene molecule". Try again. 

If you typed `2` for Platonic solids, you will then see a prompt asking you to choose from `tetrahedron` or `cube` or `dodecahedraon`. Apologise for not including information of other 2 Platonic solids. The programme will be updated in the future.


## Results 
The programme returns the energies in a list, followed by degeneracies.
